It is no python code. It is a maths problem.
60,70,80,85,90,100
7 students

overall average?
mdddle students 
score apperaed

mean -> total/number of students of students
mean = (60 + 70 + 80 + 85 + 90 + 100) / 6
mean = 485 / 6
mean = 80.83 (approx)
median -> middle score when arranged in order
median = (80 + 85) / 2
median = 82.5
even meadian -> average of two middle scores
odd median -> middle score
mode -> score that appears most frequently
mode = no mode (all scores appear only once)

In ML learing

100 students->95 boys ans 5 girls 
unbalanced gender dataset
accuracy -> 95%
It is biased model(only predicts)

pedication value =80/100
actual value=60/100
difference between predication and actual value is error

predicated value y_pred=what our model thinks will happen

student  Actual Predicted Error
A        60     90         30
B       70     80         10

Analysing Error
how much you earning?
ep=30k
al=3cr
it called outlier

data:[25,30,45,34,30000]
outlier:30000
al=30k
60:100 ratio 
60% strike 

% ratio  

Accuracy=(Correction predication/Total Predication)*100
Precision=(True Positives/Total predicative positives)
Recall=(True Positive/Total predictive positives)

perentage - out of 100 - how much happened
ration=part/whole 

total =100
correct=90
wrong=10
Accuracy=90%

15 actual
Precision=15/20=0.75=75%
