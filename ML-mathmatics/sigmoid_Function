What is the Sigmoid Function? (Core Idea)

The sigmoid function takes any real number and squeezes it into a value between 0 and 1.

Mathematical Formula
The sigmoid function is mathematically represented as:σ(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(−x))

Where:

x → input (can be −∞ to +∞)

e → Euler’s number (≈ 2.718)

σ(x) → output in range (0, 1)

📌 This is why sigmoid is perfect for probability output.
